    Get as inputs file path for edges of the graph. Returns a

    Parameters
    -----------
    fname_edges : path to a csv file of edge information in the

    Time,Node1,Node2,Edge-Type1,Edge-Type2

    Time: Integer indicating the time the pair of nodes
    
    Edge-Type1 : Binary value. 0 (1) indicates absence (presence) of
    an edge of type 1

    Edge-Type2 : Binary value. 0 (1) indicates absence (presence) of
    an edge of type 2

    The file could be an edge-list, i.e., a list of only the edges
    present in the network or a list of all possible node-pairs with
    information of edges that are absent.

    fname_nodes : optional, path to a csv file with node information
    with the following format.  Time,Node

    Assumptions:
    - The values for Time above is non-decreasing.
    - When there is a change, time increases by 1.

    method : method to use when the set of nodes between two time
    steps are not the same. The variable accepts the strings `union`
    or `intersection`.

    Returns
    --------
    counts : dictionary with time steps as key and the np.array of
